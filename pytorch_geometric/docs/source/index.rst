PyG Documentation
=================

:pyg:`null` **PyG** *(PyTorch Geometric)* is a library built upon :pytorch:`null` `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/>`_ to easily write and train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for a wide range of applications related to structured data.

It consists of various methods for deep learning on graphs and other irregular structures, also known as `geometric deep learning <http://geometricdeeplearning.com/>`_, from a variety of published papers.
In addition, it consists of easy-to-use mini-batch loaders for operating on many small and single giant graphs, `multi GPU-support <https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric/tree/master/examples/multi_gpu>`_, `DataPipe support <https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric/blob/master/examples/datapipe.py>`_, distributed graph learning via `Quiver <https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric/tree/master/examples/quiver>`_, a large number of common benchmark datasets (based on simple interfaces to create your own), the `GraphGym <advanced/graphgym.html>`__ experiment manager, and helpful transforms, both for learning on arbitrary graphs as well as on 3D meshes or point clouds.
