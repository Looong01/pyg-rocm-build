Multi-GPU Training in Pure PyTorch
==================================

For many large scale, real-world datasets, it may be necessary to scale-up training across multiple GPUs.
This tutorial goes over how to set up a multi-GPU training and inference pipeline in :pyg:`PyG` with pure :pytorch:`PyTorch` via :class:`torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel`, without the need for any other third-party libraries (such as :lightning:`PyTorch Lightning`).

In particular, this tutorials shows how to train a :class:`~torch_geometric.nn.models.GraphSAGE` GNN model on the :class:`~torch_geometric.datasets.Reddit` dataset.
For this, we utilize the :class:`~torch_geometric.loader.NeighborLoader` together with :class:`torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel` to scale-up training across all available GPUs.

.. note::
    A runnable example of this tutorial can be found at `examples/multi_gpu/distributed_sampling.py <https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric/blob/master/examples/multi_gpu/distributed_sampling.py>`_.

Defining a Spawnable Runner
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`DistributedDataParallel (DDP) <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/ddp_tutorial.html>`_ implements data parallelism at the module level which can run across multiple machines.
Applications using DDP spawn multiple processes and create a single DDP instance per process.
DDP processes can be placed on the same machine or across machines.

To create a DDP module, we first need to set up process groups properly and define a spawnable runner function.
Here, the :obj:`world_size` corresponds to the number of GPUs we will be using at once.
For each GPU, the process is labeled with a process ID which we call :obj:`rank`.
:meth:`torch.multiprocessing.spawn` will take care of spawning :obj:`world_size` many processes:

.. code-block:: python

    from torch_geometric.datasets import Reddit
    import torch.multiprocessing as mp

    def run(rank: int, world_size: int, dataset: Reddit):
        pass

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        dataset = Reddit('./data/Reddit')
        world_size = torch.cuda.device_count()
        mp.spawn(run, args=(world_size, dataset), nprocs=world_size, join=True)

Note that we initialize the dataset *before* spawning any processes.
With this, we only initialize the dataset once, and any data inside it will be automatically moved to shared memory via :obj:`torch.multiprocessing` such that processes do not need to create their own replica of the data.

With this, we can start to implement our spawnable runner function.
The first step is to initialize :obj:`torch.distributed`.
More details can be found in `Writing Distributed Applications with PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/dist_tuto.html>`_:

.. code-block:: python

    import os
    import torch.distributed as dist
    import torch

    def run(rank: int, world_size: int, dataset: Reddit):
        os.environ['MASTER_ADDR'] = 'localhost'
        os.environ['MASTER_PORT'] = '12345'
        dist.init_process_group('nccl', rank=rank, world_size=world_size)

Next, we split training indices into :obj:`world_size` many chunks for each GPU, and initialize the :class:`~torch_geometric.loader.NeighborLoader` class to only operate on its specific chunk of the training set:

.. code-block:: python

    from torch_geometric.loader import NeighborLoader

    def run(rank: int, world_size: int, dataset: Reddit):
        ...

        data = dataset[0]

        train_index = data.train_mask.nonzero().view(-1)
        train_index = train_index.split(train_index.size(0) // world_size)[rank]

        train_loader = NeighborLoader(
            data,
            input_nodes=train_index,
            num_neighbors=[25, 10],
            batch_size=1024,
            num_workers=4,
            shuffle=True,
        )

Note that our :meth:`run` function is called on each rank, which means that each rank holds a separate :class:`~torch_geometric.loader.NeighborLoader` instance.

Similarly, we create a :class:`~torch_geometric.loader.NeighborLoader` instance for evaluation.
For simplicity, we only do this on rank :obj:`0` such that computation of metrics do not need to communicate across different processes.
We recommend to take a look at the `torchmetrics <https://torchmetrics.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ package for distributed computation of metrics.

.. code-block:: python

    def run(rank: int, world_size: int, dataset: Reddit):
        ...

        if rank == 0:
            val_index = data.val_mask.nonzero().view(-1)
            val_loader = NeighborLoader(
                data,
                input_nodes=val_index,
                num_neighbors=[25, 10],
                batch_size=1024,
                num_workers=4,
                shuffle=False,
            )

Now that we have our data loaders defined, we initialize our :class:`~torch_geometric.nn.GraphSAGE` model and wrap it inside :pytorch:`PyTorch`'s :class:`~torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel`.
This wrapper on our model manages communication between each rank and reduces loss gradients from each process before updating the models parameters across all ranks:

.. code-block:: python

    from torch.nn.parallel import DistributedDataParallel
    from torch_geometric.nn import GraphSAGE

    def run(rank: int, world_size: int, dataset: Reddit):
        ...

        torch.manual_seed(12345)
        model = GraphSAGE(
            in_channels=dataset.num_features,
            hidden_channels=256,
            num_layers=2,
            out_channels=dataset.num_classes,
        ).to(rank)
        model = DistributedDataParallel(model, device_ids=[rank])

Finally, we can set up our optimizer and define our training loop, which follows a similar flow as usual single GPU training loops  - the actual magic of gradient and model weight synchronization across different processes will happen behind the scenes within :class:`~torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel`:

.. code-block:: python

    import torch.nn.functional as F

    def run(rank: int, world_size: int, dataset: Reddit):
        ...

        optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

        for epoch in range(1, 11):
            model.train()
            for batch in train_loader:
                batch = batch.to_rank
                optimizer.zero_grad()
                out = model(batch.x, batch.edge_index)[:batch.batch_size]
                loss = F.cross_entropy(out, batch.y[:batch.batch_size])
                loss.backward()
                optimizer.step()

After each training epoch, we evaluate and report validation metrics.
As previously mentioned, we do this on a single GPU only.
To synchronize all processes and to ensure that model weights have been updated, we need to call :meth:`torch.distributed.barrier`:

.. code-block:: python

            dist.barrier()

            if rank == 0:
                print(f'Epoch: {epoch:02d}, Loss: {loss:.4f}')

            if rank == 0:
                model.eval()
                count = correct = 0
                with torch.no_grad():
                    for batch in val_loader:
                        batch = batch.to(rank)
                        out = model(batch.x, batch.edge_index)[:batch.batch_size]
                        pred = out.argmax(dim=-1)
                        correct += (pred == batch.y[:batch.batch_size]).sum()
                        count += batch.batch_size
                print(f'Validation Accuracy: {correct/count:.4f}')

            dist.barrier()

After finishing training, we can clean up processes and destroy the process group via:

.. code-block:: python

        dist.destroy_process_group()

And that's it.
Putting it all together gives a working multi-GPU example that follows a similar training flow than single GPU training.
